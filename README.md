# RealZodiac

Astronomical zodiac calculator — shows where the Sun actually was when you were born.

## Run locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (astronomy-engine only)
npm install

# Serve the public/ folder — any static server works:
npx serve public

# or
npx http-server public

# or Python
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory public
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port the server reports).

## First-time setup

Star data must be generated before first run:

```bash
npm run filter
```

This downloads star data from d3-celestial and writes two files to `public/data/`:
- `stars.ecliptic.json`
- `constellations.zodiac.json` (already committed)
